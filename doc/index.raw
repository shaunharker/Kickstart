== Purpose

This project is intended to help setup portable build systems for projects using CMake.
We provide several scripts to make this simpler.

== How open source installations work

An open source installation typically installs itself into certain well-known directories.
Most commonly, a project will want to install its files in the following locations

```
/usr/local/include   (header files to be used in conjunction with libraries or as stand-alone)
/usr/local/lib       (libraries which can be used by other programs)
/usr/local/bin       (executable files)
/usr/local/share     (manuals, supplementary files)
```

Here the prefix `/usr/local` is called the _installation prefix_. The setting of `/usr/local` is a common
default, and the scripts in this package assume this. For example, on Mac OS X, the popular Homebrew 
package manager installs into `/usr/local`. (Incidentally, it whines about other stuff installed in there,
but this can be safely ignored unless you are specifically double-installing something.)

On other systems, for example an HPC cluster, it is very unlikely you will be able to install into `/usr/local`.
The reason is because this is a system folder which you will not have the privileges to write to. System
administrators, who may not have the time to accurately assess what interactions a proposed installation may have to
system stability (it is their job not to trust the user who says it is safe) are very hesitant about changing anything
in system folders. This means the most straightforward path is simply to choose a different installation prefix than
the default. Accordingly, a good installer script should allow us to choose the installation prefix. If the argument 
to set the installation prefix is omitted, it should default to `/usr/local`.


== Installation


```
./install.sh
```
